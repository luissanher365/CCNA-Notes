Welcome! This repository contains my personal notes, summaries, and resources compiled while preparing for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA 200-301) certification exam. All notes are being created using Obsidian, leveraging its Markdown format and interlinking capabilities to aid in studying. I am also using Packet Tracer as my primary lab environment to test and verify all configurations.

<br>

## ✅ Prerequisites

To effectively use these notes and run the lab configurations, you will need:

* **Cisco Packet Tracer:** Used to create and test all lab topologies (`.pkt` files).
* **Obsidian:** (Optional) If you want to use the notes with the internal links and graph view, you will need the Obsidian application.
* **Basic Understanding of Networking:** This material assumes prior exposure to fundamental networking concepts (e.g., binaries, IP addresses, basic command-line interface familiarity).
